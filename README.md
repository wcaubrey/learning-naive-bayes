Follow my blog [here](https://mydatascienceacademy.com/) to learn more about the code.

## My first notebook
This repository contains my first notebook using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The notebook is a simple implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
It can be found here: ```notebooks/sample-naive-bayes.ipynb```

In it put the steps needed to perform classification in the cells of a Jupyter notebook. Each step is in its own cell.
I based the notebook on an example from Wikipedia that can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).
